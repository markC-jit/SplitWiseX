🧠 SplitWise X — Unified AI-Powered Prediction Market Aggregator
Prediction markets today are highly fragmented — liquidity, pricing, and odds are scattered across multiple platforms.
Users face major pain points:
-Time wasted manually comparing odds across platforms
-Complex math required to optimize bets
-Strategies exposed publicly, risking front-running
-Wallet fragmentation between EVM (MetaMask) and non-EVM (Polkadot) ecosystems

✅ Our Solution
-SplitWise X is a cross-chain prediction market aggregator that consolidates liquidity and pricing into a single interface — powered by AI and secured with TEE privacy.

🚀 Key Features
Feature	Description:
-🔗 Multi-Wallet Support	Connect with MetaMask (EVM) or SubWallet (Polkadot)
-🧠 AI Rate Optimizer	Automatically computes the best odds across platforms (toggle ON/OFF)
-🏦 Unified Liquidity	Aggregates data from The Graph, Oasis Sapphire, SubQuery, Zeitgeist
-🔒 Privacy-Preserving	All computation happens inside Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)


Core Components
1. Frontend Application:
-Framework: Next.js 15.5.4 with React 19.1.0
-Styling: Tailwind CSS 4.0
-State Management: React Context API
-Wallet Integration: MetaMask + SubWallet (Polkadot)
2. Smart Contract System:
-Language: Solidity ^0.8.20
-Privacy: Oasis Sapphire TEE integration
-Authentication: SiweAuth for privacy-preserving access
-Multi-platform: Supports Polymarket, Augur, Gnosis
3. Data Infrastructure:
